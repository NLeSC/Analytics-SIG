#  NLeSc Statistics Special Interest Group

## Bring your own statistics challenges

Do you have a statistical issue? You can bring your issue to the SIG -- we can look at the issue together and do our best to help you find the most suitable solution.

### What do you need?

 - Open an issue on GitHub and label it `Help | Title`.
 - Describe the type of issue you want to address. Make sure to include:
    - What is your final goal?
    - What is the challenge?
    - A sample of your code (if possible).

We will discuss your issue during the next SIG meeting.

## Share your statistics solutions
