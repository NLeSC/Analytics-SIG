## Outline

1. Intro _(1.25 min)_
    - The two meanings of the word computational
    - Mathematics is everywhere. Yes, also in your project
2. What is our format? _(0.5 min)_
    - Two meetings per month. Each with a different purpose:
        - Firmly building a skill
        - Learning a bit about interesting topics
3. Firmly building a skill _(0.5 min)_
    - Currently we are learning Network Theory
    - We are following a book
    - Every month, a member of the SIG presents a section of the book
4. Interesting topics _(1.5 min)_
    - Such as
        - Voronoi diagrams
            - Example application: airport networks
        - Complex numbers
            - Example application: aerodynamics
        - Random walks
            - Example application: stochastic systems theory
5. Outro _(0.75 min)_
    - If your project uses analysis, statistics, algebra or geometry, you may want to talk to us!
        - If not, also let us know. It is really hard to find a project that doesn't!
    - We are Dafne, Johan, Sarah and Pablo R.
    - Want to join? Contact us!
    - Do you think, or even suspect, we may be of help? Contact us!
