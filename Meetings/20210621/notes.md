# Brainstorming session

Linking eScience engineers and applied mathematicians

_Machine Learning, all of computational structural mechanics, quantum chemistry, electronics or fluid dynamics rely on linear algebra to solve the domain problems. Interestingly most algorithms to solve large linear systems and eigenvalue problems were designed 20+ years ago. While the Netherlands has been the source of many of these algorithms the field has produced new algorithms which somehow have not found their way into professional software packages. We want to explore how we can help to assist in making new mathematical research and algorithms available to widely used linear algebra packages and thus provide application developers to state of the art tools for their own research._

Lead by Jens Wehner.

## Talk

We face lots of mathematical challenges at the eScience center.
Most of them related to linear algebra. Even more, mostly matrix inversion.
Sparse matrix inversion is particularly important. This problem is typically solved with iterative-variational algorithms.
The Netherlands seems to be a powerhouse in this kind of algorithms.
Most of them have not found their way to standard software packages.
Why not contact their authors?
Companies such as Vortech or Mathware are already doing this (behind a paywall).
Large scale computing is on the National Agenda.
Mathematicians typically are not interested in maintaining packages.

## Brainstorming notes

### Sonja
- The lack of interest in maintaining software happens everywhere, not only in mathematics.
- Theoretical professionals don't get much professional credit for applied results.
- In the Netherlands all mathematics departments are also computer science departments.

### Johan
- CGAL library about computational geometry as an example of success.
  - They have a strong organization behind.
- Long term commitment has to come from the mathematician side.

### Nicolas
- Better start with a small scale initiative.
- We don't want to create an equivalent of CGAL.
- Increase communication between relatively isolated communities.
- We are not marketing ourselves attractive enough for mathematicians.

### Sarah
- Agrees with starting small.
- Maybe first organize a workshop in the scope of the SIGs.
- General outreach: have more public SIGs, promoted in the newsletter.
- Writing SIG hours is still an issue.

### Jens
- Connect theory to application. They are surprisingly far away from each other.
- We don't really know the math community. We didn't have cooperation yet.
- Some algorithms require the mathematician's support to be implemented.
- Who is interested? Do we have people enough to go ahead?

### Willem
- Talking as a tech lead: this sounds like a good idea.
- Look at what mathematical tools we use in the projects.
  - Perhaps do a poll?

### Pablo R.
- Some pure mathematicians just do not like applications.

### Gijs
- It is not only mathematics. Some solutions really require advanced skills such as GPU programming.

### Yang
- He would like to know more.
- Suggests inviting mathematicians to give talks at the eScience center.
